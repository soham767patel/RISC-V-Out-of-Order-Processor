# RISC-V Processor Project Report

Welcome to my **RISC-V Processor Project Report**!  
This repository contains the documentation and analysis of my custom implementation of a RISC-V processor.

## ðŸ“˜ About

This project focuses on the design, structure, and performance evaluation of a RISC-V CPU.  
It covers architectural components, pipeline design, instruction execution, and testing methodology.  
The report highlights both theoretical understanding and practical implementation details.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Based on the **RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**  
- Modular and scalable design  
- Focus on instruction decoding, ALU operation, and control unit design  
- Includes simulation results and verification data
